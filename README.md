This code contains an easy game of Hangman.
You have 6 tries to guess the correct word in order to win the game. 
The first function choose_word chooses a random word from a list.
The second function shows a dashed line for the letters which have not been guessed correctly until now and vice versa.
The third function is the game itself, counting the amount of wrong guesses until you have either finished the game or have 6 wrong guesses.
